	<h1>Proof Questions - Overview</h1>
	<p>A <strong>proof question</strong> on WeBWorK asks you to formally
	show that some statement is true.

	<p>A proof-question gives you several pieces of information:
	<ul>
		<li>The <em>given statements</em> which is what you are
			told you know to be true.
		<li>The <em>deduction rules</em> which are the ways
			statements can logically follow from previous statements
		<li>The <em>conclusion</em> which is the statement that
			you are trying to show to be true.
	</ul>

	<p>For a proof question, you must write a series of statements which
	logically follow from the <em>given statements</em> that end
	with the specified <em>conclusion</em>.

	<p>Each <em>line</em> in the proof is made up of several parts:
	<ul>
		<li>The <em>statement</em> that the line asserts to be true
		<li>The <em>justification</em> of the line which includes
			<ul>
				<li>a <em>deduction rule</em>
				<li>some <em>references</em> to previous lines
					that the deduction rule requires
			</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>WeBWorK <em>verifies</em> that each line in your proof
	correctly follows from the lines before it.
	When you click "Preview My Answers" or "Check Answers",
	WeBWorK will point out any problems in your proof.

	<p><strong>The checker is very pedantic</strong>. It requires
	you to <strong>write proofs that skip no steps</strong>.
	Something as simple as <code>x+y</code> being replaced with
	<code>y+x</code> needs a line in your proof.

	<p>There are multiple ways to type some statements.
	You can use <em>whichever one you prefer</em>, though the ones
	with more parentheses might be helpful if WeBWorK is having
	trouble understanding you.

	<h2>Solving and Filling-Out Proof Problems</h2>
	<p>It is probably easiest to <strong>first sketch the solution out
	on paper</strong>. Once you have the basic outline planned on paper,
	then <strong>try to enter the proof one line at a time</strong>.

	<p>You can <strong>click "Preview My Answers" at any time to get
	feedback on the proof you've written so far</strong>. Getting your
	proof accepted one line at a time will make fixing typos and logic
	errors less frustrating.

	<h3>A simple example - Notation</h3>
	<p>Let's use the proof checker to check the famous syllogism,

	<blockquote>
		All men are mortal.<br>
		Socrates is a man.<br>
		Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
	</blockquote>

	<p>First, this has to be written in a more formal notation.

	<p><strong>Predicates</strong> like <code>x is mortal</code>
	are typically written as <code>mortal(x)</code> in math.
	WeBWorK allows you to write predicates in any of the three ways:
	<ul>
		<li><code>x is a mortal</code>
		<li><code>x is mortal</code>
		<li><code>mortal(x)</code>
	</ul>
	<p>All three forms are equivalent. You can use whichever you
	prefer.


	<p>To express a concept like "a man is a mortal", we have to
	state it as an <strong>implication (if ... then ...)</strong>.
	You can use
	<code>if ... then ...</code> or <code>=&gt;</code> to create
	implications.

	<p>For example, "a man is a mortal" might be written as either
	<ul>
		<li><code>if x is a man then x is a mortal</code>
		<li><code>x is a man => x is a mortal</code>
	</ul>

	<p>General statements like those involving the
	words <strong>all</strong> or <strong>any</strong> must be stated
	explicitly using <strong>quantifiers</strong>.

	<p>Quantifiers can be written like predicates; they can also be
	written without <code>()</code>.

	<p>For example,
	"everyone loves icecream" might be written as any of the following:
	<ul>
		<li><code>forall(x, loves(x, icecream))</code>
		<li><code>all(x, loves(x, icecream))</code>
		<li><code>forall x loves(x, icecream)</code>
		<li><code>all x loves(x, icecream)</code>
	</ul>

	<h3>A simple example - WeBWorK</h3>

	<p>Here is how the problem would be presented to you in WeBWorK.
	(This is the first exercise assigned to you; you can follow along!)

	<p><img src="blank-syllogism.png" alt="a simple syllogism in webwork">

	<p>You can recognize that we want to use
	<code>x is a man => x is a mortal</code>
	together with the fact that <code>Socrates is a man</code>.
	The deduction rule that allows us to use <code>A => B</code> and
	<code>A</code>
	together to conclude <code>B</code> is called
	<strong>modus ponens</strong>.

	<p>First, try entering <code>Socrates is mortal</code>.
	Click "Preview My Answers" to see what WeBWorK has to say about that.

	<p><img src="no-reason-syllogism.png">
	<p>WeBWorK will tell you that you need to include a justification for
	the line you just added. Pick <em>modus&nbsp;ponens</em> from the
	dropdown.

	<p><img src="refers-syllogism.png">
	<p>WeBWorK asks you to tell it what previous lines this new line is
	referring to. In this case, we want column &#9398; to refer to line 1
	and column &#9399; to refer to line 2. You can look at either the error
	message or the list of deduction rules to see what is expected for each
	column.

	<p><img src="eliminate-syllogism.png">
	<p>WeBWorK rejects this attempt because line 1 is actually a
	<em>quantified</em> implication, but modus ponens requires a
	<em>bare</em> implication.

	<p><strong>Sorry, but the computer is pedantic.</strong> We need to get
	a statement that looks <strong>exactly</strong> like
	<code>man(Socrates) => mortal(Socrates)</code> in order to use it with
	<code>man(Socrates)</code>.

	<p>We can <em>conclude</em> such a statement from line 1 using the
	<em>Eliminate a For-All</em> deduction rule.

	<p><img src="eliminated-syllogism.png">

	<p>Finally, modus-ponens can be used to reach the conclusion.

	<p><img src="correct-syllogism.png">

	<p>You can submit your correct proof!

	<p>Being this careful can help you avoid writing incorrect proofs.
	Taking smaller steps can help you avoid logical fallacies and
	other pitfalls that WeBWorK will reject. However, writing proofs
	in this way is not easy.
