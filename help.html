	<h1>Proof Questions - Overview</h1>

	<p>A <strong>proof question</strong> on WeBWorK asks you to formally
	show that some statement is true.

	<p>A proof-question gives you several pieces of information:
	<ul>
		<li>The <em>given statements</em> which is what you are
			told you know to be true.
		<li>The <em>deduction rules</em> which are the ways
			statements can logically follow from previous statements
		<li>The <em>conclusion</em> which is the statement that
			you are trying to show to be true.
	</ul>

	<p>For a proof question, you must write a series of statements which
	logically follow from the <em>given statements</em> that end
	with the specified <em>conclusion</em>.

	<p>Each <em>line</em> in the proof is made up of several parts:
	<ul>
		<li>The <em>statement</em> that the line asserts to be true
		<li>The <em>justification</em> of the line which includes
			<ul>
				<li>a <em>deduction rule</em>
				<li>some <em>references</em> to previous lines
					that the deduction rule requires
			</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>WeBWorK <em>verifies</em> that each line in your proof
	correctly follows from the lines before it.
	When you click "Preview My Answers" or "Check Answers",
	WeBWorK will point out any problems in your proof.

	<p><strong>The checker is very pedantic</strong>. It requires
	you to <strong>write proofs that skip no steps</strong>.
	Something as simple as <code>x+y</code> being replaced with
	<code>y+x</code> needs a line in your proof.

	<p>There are multiple ways to type some statements.
	You can use <em>whichever one you prefer</em>, though the ones
	with more parentheses might be helpful if WeBWorK is having
	trouble understanding you.

	<h2>Simple Proof Problems</h2>

	<p>It is probably easiest to <strong>first sketch the solution out
	on paper</strong>. Once you have the basic outline planned on paper,
	then <strong>try to enter the proof one line at a time</strong>.

	<p class=starred>You can <strong>click "Preview My Answers" at any time to get
	feedback on the proof you've written so far</strong>. Getting your
	proof accepted one line at a time will make fixing typos and logic
	errors less frustrating.</p>

	<h3>A simple example - Notation</h3>

	<p>Let's use the proof checker to check the famous syllogism,

	<blockquote>
		All men are mortal.<br>
		Socrates is a man.<br>
		Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
	</blockquote>

	<p>First, this has to be written in a more formal notation.

	<p><strong>Predicates</strong> like <code>x is mortal</code>
	are typically written as <code>mortal(x)</code> in math.
	WeBWorK allows you to write predicates in any of the three ways:
	<ul>
		<li><code>x is a mortal</code>
		<li><code>x is mortal</code>
		<li><code>mortal(x)</code>
	</ul>
	<p>All three forms are equivalent. You can use whichever you
	prefer.


	<p>To express a concept like "a man is a mortal", we have to
	state it as an <strong>implication (if ... then ...)</strong>.
	You can use
	<del><code>if ... then ...</code> or</del> <code>=&gt;</code> to create
	implications.

	<p>For example, "a man is a mortal" might be written as either
	<ul>
		<li><del><code>if x is a man then x is a mortal</code></del>
		<li><code>x is a man => x is a mortal</code>
	</ul>

	<p>General statements like those involving the
	words <strong>all</strong> or <strong>any</strong> must be stated
	explicitly using <strong>quantifiers</strong>.

	<p>Quantifiers can be written like predicates; <del>they can also be
	written without <code>()</code></del>.

	<p>For example,
	"everyone loves icecream" might be written as any of the following:
	<ul>
		<li><code>forall(x, loves(x, icecream))</code>
		<li><code>all(x, loves(x, icecream))</code>
		<li><del><code>forall x loves(x, icecream)</code></del>
		<li><del><code>all x loves(x, icecream)</code></del>
	</ul>

	<h3 id=tutorial>A simple example - WeBWorK</h3>

	<p>Here is how the problem would be presented to you in WeBWorK.
	<p class=starred>This is the first exercise assigned to you;
		you can follow along!</p>

	<p><img src="blank-syllogism.png"
		alt="(WeBWorK representation of 'Socrates is mortal' syllogism)">

	<p>You can recognize that we want to use
	<code>x is a man => x is a mortal</code>
	together with the fact that <code>Socrates is a man</code>.
	The deduction rule that allows us to use <code>A => B</code> and
	<code>A</code>
	together to conclude <code>B</code> is called
	<strong>modus ponens</strong>.

	<p>The conclusion, <code>Socrates is mortal</code> is already entered
	for you in line 4.

	<p class=starred>Click "Preview My Answers" to see what WeBWorK
	wants you to do.

	<p><img src="no-reason-syllogism.png"
		alt="(4. The justification in line 4 is blank. Select a justification)">
	<p>WeBWorK will tell you that you need to include a justification for
	each line in the proof.

	<p class=starred>Try using <em>modus&nbsp;ponens</em> from the dropdown as the
	justification for line 4.

	<p><img src="refers-syllogism.png"
		alt="(4. You left column A blank... the line number of a P=&gt;Q statement)">
	<p>WeBWorK asks you to tell it what previous lines this new line is
	referring to.

	<p>Modus Ponens requires an implication <code>P => Q</code>
	for the &#9398; column. A statement similar to 1 might work.

 	<p>Modus Ponens also needs the corresponding <code>P</code> statement.
	Line 2 might work in this case.

	<p class=starred>Try entering 1 for &#9398; and 2 for &#9399; in justification
	for the 4th line.

	<p><img src="eliminate-syllogism.png"
		alt="(4. ...However, forall x &lt;...&gt; was used instead of an implication)">
	<p>WeBWorK rejects this attempt because line 1 is actually a
	<em>quantified</em> implication, but modus ponens requires a
	<em>bare</em> implication.

	<p><strong>Sorry, but the computer is pedantic.</strong> We need to get
	a statement that looks <strong>exactly</strong> like
	<code>man(Socrates) => mortal(Socrates)</code> in order to use it with
	<code>man(Socrates)</code>. The extra <code>forall x, ...</code> gets
	in the way of modus-ponens.

	<p>We can <em>conclude</em> the bare implication
	<code>Socrates is man => Socrates is mortal</code>
	<em>using line 1</em> by the
	<em>Eliminate a For-All</em> deduction rule.

	<p>This conclusion can go into the blanks on line 3.

	<p class=starred>Use the "Eliminate a For-All" deduction rule on line 1 to justify
	<code>Socrates is man => Socrates is mortal</code> on line 3.

	<p class=starred>Make sure to fix the modus-ponens line to refer to the
	correct previous lines. WeBWorK error messages will give hints.

	<p><img src="correct-syllogism.png"
		alt="(All lines so far are justified correctly. correct)">

	<p>You can submit your correct proof!

	<p>Being this careful can help you avoid writing incorrect proofs.
	Taking smaller steps can help you avoid logical fallacies and
	other pitfalls that WeBWorK will reject. However, writing proofs
	in this way is not easy.

	<hr>
	<h2>Suproofs Example</h2>

	<p>Sometimes in proofs we need something that looks like this:

	<blockquote>
		<strong>Suppose that p/q = &radic;2 and p is not divisible by q.</strong><br>
		<div class=indent>
			Then, p<sup>2</sup>/q<sup>2</sup> = 2.<br>
			Thus p<sup>2</sup> = 2q<sup>2</sup>.<br>
			So, p<sup>2</sup> is divisible by 2, so p is divisible by 2.<br>
			Also, q<sup>2</sup> is divisible by 2, so q is divisble by 2.
		</div>
		<strong>This is a contradiction; therefore &radic;2 must be irrational.</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<p>We begin by supposing something that is not (necessarily) true,
	and then use that supposition to conclude other facts.

	<p>You cannot <em>directly</em> use the facts you simply "suppose" to
	be true to finish your proof. For example, this obviously
	<strong>incorrect</strong> proof:

	<blockquote class=incorrect>
		<strong>Suppose that p/q = &radic;2 and p is not divisible by q.</strong><br>
		<div class=indent>
		</div>
		<strong>Therefore, since p/q=&radic;2, &radic;2 must be rational.</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<p>You can introduce a new <strong>claim</strong> or
	<strong>supposition</strong>, and <strong>conclude</strong> from that
	a limited number of statements. You can only use the claim while
	writing the <strong>sub</strong>proof.

	<p>This is useful in order to create proofs that look like the following,
	which introduces a <code>P => Q</code> statement:

	<blockquote>
		Suppose it rained this morning.<br>
		<div class=indent>
			Since when it rains, the grass is wet; thus the grass is wet now<br>
		</div>
		Therefore, <em>if it rained this morning, then the grass is wet.</em>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The above, written slightly more carefuly, looks like:

	<blockquote>
		<strong>Suppose</strong> <code>rained(today)</code>.
		<div class=indent>
			Thus <code>grasswet(today)</code>.
		</div>
		<strong>Therefore</strong>, <code>rained(today) => grasswet(today)</code>.
	</blockquote>

	<h3>Subproofs example - There Exists</h3>

	<p class=starred>This section corresponds to the second tutorial
		WeBWorK problem.

	<p>In WeBWorK, subproofs can also be used to eliminate
	"there exists" quantifiers, by giving a <em>name</em> to the
	thing that exists:

	<blockquote>
		1. <code>forall n, P(n) => Q(n)</code>.<br>
		2. <code>exists x, P(x)</code>.<br>
		3. <strong>Suppose</strong> that "x" is called <code>bob</code>, i.e., <code>P(bob)</code>.
		<div class=indent>
			4. <code>P(bob) => Q(bob)</code> from (1.).<br>
			5. <code>Q(bob)</code> from (3.) and (4.).<br>
			6. <code>exists x, Q(x)</code> from (5.).<br>
		</div>
		7. <strong>Conclude</strong> <code>exists x, Q(x)</code>.
	</blockquote>

	<p>Note the unfortunate redundancy between lines (6.) and (7.).
	<p>Statement (6.) is deduced from statement (5.), which is
	still part of the subproof. Therefore (6.) must be part of the
	subproof.
	<p>However, we ultimately want to conclude (7.), so we must
	move it to be the <em>conclusion</em> of the subproof as well.

	<p class=starred>WeBWorK requires you to explain <em>what kind</em> of subproof
	you are writing. The above example <em>eliminates a "there exists"</em>,
	so you should use "begin Eliminate a There-Exists Subproof".

	<p><img src="subproof-outline.png"
		alt="P(bob) from 'begin eliminate there-exists sub-proof; conclude sub-proof with exists(x, Q(x))">

	<p class=starred>The above is how you might begin the problem. Use the
	hints from WeBWorK and this section to finish this subproof problem.

	<h4>How to use an and/conjunction statement</h4>
	<p>Use "Eliminate an And". The statement <code>A &amp; B</code> can be used to deduce either <code>A</code> or <code>B</code>.

	<h3>for all, all, every, &forall;</h3>
	<h4>How to type all/for all/every/&forall; statements</h4>
	<p>You can write "&forall;x P(x)" as <code>forall(x, P(x))</code> or <code>all(x, P(x))</code>.
	<h4>How to deduce all/for all/every/&forall; statements</h4>
	<p>If you have a "general" statement, like <code>P(x)</code>
		and <code>x</code> is a "free" variable, you can conclude <code>all(x, P(x))</code>.
		A variable is <em>not</em> free if it's used in a claim or a given statement.
	<p>Usually, "eliminate a for-all statement" can be used to create free variables.
	<h4>How to use a all/for all/every&forall; statement</h4>
	<p>If you have a statement like <code>all(x, P(x, x))</code> you can use
		"Eliminate a For-All" to conclude any statement of the form
		<code>P(__, __)</code>, for example, <code>P(u, u)</code> or <code>P(3, 3)</code>.

	<h3>exists, there is, &exist;</h3>
	<h4>How to type exists/there is/&exist;</h4>
